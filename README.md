# MERN Blog Project

This is a **MERN stack blog application** where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The **backend is fully functional** using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the **frontend is partially implemented** and may crash in some areas due to limited time. All backend APIs can be tested via Postman, and instructions and screenshots are provided to demonstrate the working features.

Note: Due to time limits, I could not finish the frontend completely. I also used **AI help** to solve errors and implement some features.

## Project Structure

The main folder contains two subfolders: `backend` (APIs and server) and `frontend` (React app).

## How to Run

- **Backend:**

  1. Navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  3. Start the server: `npm start`
  4. Test APIs at `http://localhost:5000` using Postman

- **Frontend:**
  1. Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  3. Start the app: `npm start`
     > Note: Some frontend pages may crash as implementation is partial.

## Key Features

- Fully functional backend APIs for blog CRUD operations
- User authentication (signup/login)
- MongoDB database integration
- Partially implemented frontend for demonstration
